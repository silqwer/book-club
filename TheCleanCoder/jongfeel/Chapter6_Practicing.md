# Chapter 6 Practicing

## Discussions

`Professional programmers practice on their own time.`
Did you have any practice not using your primary language and framework your own times?

I have sometimes math problems use other programming languages.
And I'm doing discussions about software other field programmers(use python, java, etc) after review the books.
All this actions doing my own times not employer's.
